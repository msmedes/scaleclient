# scaleclient

## Running locally

You will need at least one [scale](https://github.com/msmedes/scale) client running. Just follow the instructions in the `readme` over there for instructions on how that works.

Right now the node addresses are hardcoded into the `Nodes` component.
You can remove them if you want but you won't get a nice circle with less than, like, 5 nodes.

You will need `npm` or `yarn` I guess. Right now there's only one command: `npm start`. The client should start up on `localhost:1234`.

## Running in production

You probably shouldn't do this.
